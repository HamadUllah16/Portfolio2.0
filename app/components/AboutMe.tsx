                I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with a passion for designing and building user-centric interfaces that deliver exceptional user experiences. My journey in tech began in 2022 as a Front-End Developer, where I initially struggled with elements like color schemes, typography, and design principles. Over time, I developed a deep appreciation for these details, which now significantly influence my work.

                In 2023, I was selected for the <strong>Meta Front-End Developer Specialization</strong>, sponsored by HEC. This intensive program enhanced my skills in <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and <strong>CSS pre-processors</strong> through hands-on projects and rigorous assessments. Completing the specialization within six months was a rewarding challenge, culminating in a portfolio that showcased my growth and achievements. React taught me that front-end development is more than just visual design—it’s about crafting dynamic, interactive user interfaces powered by robust business logic.

                To further expand my expertise, I delved into <strong>Next.js</strong>, a framework that transformed my approach to web development. While concepts like static site generation and server components initially seemed complex, I soon recognized their power in enabling <strong>serverless architecture</strong>, <strong>SEO optimization</strong>, and <strong>high-performance applications</strong>. Managing both client-side and server-side logic within a single repository streamlined development and deepened my appreciation for full-stack capabilities.

                Currently, I am focused on my <strong>Final Year Project</strong>, a <strong>Decentralized Electronic Voting Application</strong>. This project aims to enhance voting processes by making them <strong>more secure, anonymous, and cost-effective</strong>. It is a culmination of my skills, combining <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and <strong>Solana smart contracts</strong> to build an impactful and innovative application.
