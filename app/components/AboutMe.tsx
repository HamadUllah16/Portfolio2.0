                I&apos;m a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> passionate about designing and building user-centric interfaces and exceptional user experiences. My journey in tech began as a Front-End Developer in 2022, where I struggled initially with color schemes, fonts, and design principles. Over time, I grew to appreciate these details, and they now play a key role in my work.

                In 2023, I enrolled in <strong>Metas Front-End Developer Specialization</strong>, sponsored by HEC. This program deepened my skills in <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and <strong>CSS pre-processors</strong> through hands-on projects and rigorous assessments. Completing the specialization in six months was a rewarding challenge, capped by creating a portfolio that showcased what I&apos;d learned. React unlocked my creativity—it showed me that frontend development is much more than &quot;changing the color of a button&quot;; it&apos;s about crafting dynamic, interactive user interfaces with robust business logic.

                After honing my React skills through personal projects, I discovered <strong>Next.js</strong>—a game-changer. At first, its concepts like static pages and server components were confusing. But as I dived deeper, I realized the brilliance of its approach to <strong>serverless architecture</strong>, <strong>SEO optimization</strong>, and <strong>blazing-fast performance</strong>. The idea of managing both client and server logic in a single repository fascinated me, and I haven&apos;t looked back since.

                Currently, I&apos;m focused on my <strong>Final Year Project</strong>, a <strong>Decentralized Electronic Voting Application</strong>. This project aims to make voting easier, more secure, and anonymous while reducing costs. It&apos;s a culmination of my skills and passion for building impactful applications.
